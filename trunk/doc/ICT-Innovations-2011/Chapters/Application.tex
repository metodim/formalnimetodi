\section{Application}
\label{sec:application}
%TMACS is still in early development phase and it has the functionality needed to perform modeling, formal specification, and verification of concurrent systems. 
In this chapter we demonstrate that process of formal specification and verification for 
%two classical problems in the concurrency theory: the alternating bit protocol and the mutual exclusion algorithm of Peterson.
one classical problem: the alternating bit protocol.
