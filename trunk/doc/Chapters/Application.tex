\section{Application}

The tool we have developed is still in early development phase and as such it is very simple, however it still has the functionality needed to perform modeling, formal specification and verification of concurrent systems. Here we demonstrate that process of formal specification and verification for two classical problems in the concurrency theory: the Alternating Bit Protocol and the mutual exclusion algorithm of Peterson.
