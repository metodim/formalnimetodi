The Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS) is a young branch in process calculus introduced 
by Robin Milner. CCS's theory has promising results in the field of modeling and analysing 
of reactive systems. Despite CCS's success, there are only few computer tools that are available
for modeling and analysis of CCS's theory. This paper is a technical report of an effort to
build a tool that is able to parse CCS's expressions, build LTSs 
(Labelled Transition Systems) from CCS and can calculate if two LTS are strongly or weakly bisimilar
by using naive method or by using Fernandez's method. The tool is simple, but it has the 
functionality needed to perform modeling, specification and verification.

TODO: Revise the abstract as a short summary of the report.
