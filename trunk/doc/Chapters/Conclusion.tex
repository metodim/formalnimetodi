\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
In this paper we presented a tool for recognizing CCS expressions, building LTS graphs and calculating if two LTS are strongly or weakly bisimilar
by using naive method or by using Fernandez's method. We have successfully tested the tool with large number of examples comparing the results obtained with mCRL2 and CWB, and we also presented few examples showing the tool usage. 

Future work can include optimizing the tool response times for very large LTS graphs, also implementing prunung strategy for infinite LTS graphs. 
Also it would be usefull if the LTS graph is better visualized where every SOS rule is shown, with its source and sink nodes showing the CCS expression for each of the nodes. This visualization can be very helpfull for understanding the sematics of the CCS language for students that are starting to study it.
