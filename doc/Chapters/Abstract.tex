This paper reports on an effort to build a tool for modeling, specification, and analysis of concurrent systems. The tool implements the CCS process language and can build labeled transition systems from CCS expressions. Furthermore, it can be used to reduce the state space of a labeled transition system and to check whether two labeled transition systems exhibit the same behaviour, using strong and weak bisimulation equivalence. It can parse Henessy-Milner logic formulas and also implements the 'strong until' and 'weak until' operators. The tool has the functionality needed to perform modeling, specification, and verification, illustrated on two classical examples in the concurrency theory: the Alternating Bit Protocol and Peterson's mutual exclusion algorithm.
