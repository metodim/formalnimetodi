%TMACS is still in early development phase and it has the functionality needed to perform modeling, formal specification, and verification of concurrent systems. 
In this chapter we demonstrate that process of formal specification and verification for 
%two classical problems in the concurrency theory: the alternating bit protocol and the mutual exclusion algorithm of Peterson.
one classical problem in the concurrency theory: the alternating bit protocol. The alternating bit protocol is a simple yet effective protocol (usually used as a test case), designed to ensure reliable communication through unreliable transmission mediums, and it is used for managing the retransmission of lost messages \cite{ReactiveSystems}\cite{Kulick}.
